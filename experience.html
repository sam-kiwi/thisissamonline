      <h1>Work Experience</h2>
      <h3>Product Manager @ <a href="https://www.ripcord.com" target = "_blank">Ripcord</a></h3>
      <h4>Jan 2020 -- present</h4>
      <p>
        Ripcord is the world's first robotic digitization company, with a mission to move towards a paperless world.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Product Manager for Ripcord's Revenue Generation team (also known as BASE Jumpers), I work on our current-generation content management platform, Canopy. We have two main customers to whom we're currently delivering, our internal Delivery team and external Canopy users.
      </p>
      <p>
        I previously worked with our Digitization team, and was a PM for a suite of 7 production-floor applications for preparation, scanning, and quality control of documents. Some of my accomplishments as a PM for digitization are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Worked with a cross-functional team of 8 people to lead the redesign of user workflow via UI / UX modifications for Quality Control (QC) applications, resulting in a 40% reduction in QC time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Led discovery and development for hardware commissioning tools, resulting in >15% decrease in time to bring Ripcord robots online in production.
        </li>
        <li>
          Was a mentor for the Kleiner-Perking Fellowship program, advising a team of 6 fellows through ideation, discovery, and development of an end-to-end production feature for external customers
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Mentor (Volunteer) @ <a href="https://helpyourpeers.com" target = "_blank">Help Your Peers</a></h3>
      <h4>Mar 2020 -- Aug 2020</h4>
      <p>
        Help Your Peers was a volunteer-driven organization to help product managers worldwide affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked with mentees one-on-one and in group settings to provide resources for their job search. This included resume reviews, networking strategies, and interview preparation. I was lucky enough to help several PMs - running the gamut from early-career to late-career - prepare for and ace their upcoming interviews.

      <h3>Predictive Revenue Analyst @ <a href="https://bankershealthcaregroup.com" target = "_blank">Bankers Healthcare Group</a></h3>
      <h4>May 2019 -- Dec 2019</h4>
      <p>
        BHG is dedicated to providing financial services tailored to the needs of healthcare professionals.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked as a Predictive Revenue Analyst, creating financial models for a variety of needs, both internal and external, all geared towards revenue-increasing activities. Some of my accomplishments in this role are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identified pain points in data science process, and created an automated process for data cleaning and imputation in R to address these problems. This resulted in a 15% reduction in modeling time based on initial testing</li>
        <li>Created repeatable analysis on marketing values to determine lifetime value of a customer. This allowed BHG's marketing team to more accurately determine target customers</li>
        <li>Created an anomaly detection model to determine unlikely or likely loan defaulters that lie outside BHG's normal range of lending, leading to a 2% increase in lending</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Data Science Intern @ <a href="https://theventure.city" target="_blank">TheVentureCity</a></h3>
      <h4>Fall 2018</h4>
      <p>
        During my second semester interning for TheVentureCity, I was able to work with one of their portfolio companies, <a href="https://woomfertility.com" target="_blank">Woom Fertility</a> to create models for product stickiness. We explored several definitions of retention and different ways of slicing the data based on users' demographic information. The ultimate result of these analyses was a ranking of the stickiest features based on our final definition of retention, as well as a fully mapped-out user journey for the "ideal" customer. The most exciting part of this process was being able to turn the founders' hypothesis on its head and prove to them where their users were truly finding value and delight in the application.

      <h3>Mechanical Design Intern @ <a href="https://www.tesla.com" target="_blank">Tesla Motors</a></h3>
      <h4>Summer 2018</h4>
      <p>
        As an intern on the Mechanical Design team at Gigafactory 1, I was given two main tasks for the summer: first, I was tasked with modeling load-ramping to bring tools on line with proper utility usage. As an example, let's say I have a machine that I want to bring to full capacity on the factory floor. From day 1, we would ramp its usage up slowly but steadily until it's at full throughput. By that token, there is no need to use utilities (electricity, hot water, cold water, etc.) at their full capacity during this ramping-up period. I segmented each of the factory tools into one of ten categories and created algorithms based on empirical data to determine how much utility to feed said tool depending on throughput percentage. For modeling, I used Monte Carlo Methods since the entire project was based on probability distributions.
      </p>
      <p>My second task was as a project manager. The Mechanical Design team had built a data reconciliation tool that was secure, fast, and accurate. As the project manager, I used demos and empirical data to get widespread acceptance of the tool throughout the Gigafactory. In particular, I worked with our manufacturing partners such as Panasonic to engender trust in Tesla's ability to keep their data secure and to push for adoption. Ultimately, this tool has been responsible for saving approximately $5.6 million / year in expenditure through faster time-to-complete, reduced errors, and systematic identification of opportunities to improve design.</p>
      <h3>Finance Intern @ <a href="https://theventure.city" target="_blank">TheVentureCity</a></h3>
      <h4>Spring 2018</h4>
      <p>
        As a finance intern at TVC, I spent much of the semester learning about venture capital and assisting in research for potential portfolio companies. I did deep dives into varied verticals such as FinTech and FemTech, and contributed to investment memos on these topics. These were used to determine whether or not TVC would invest in a particular company or not.
